# Run script

- Create text file named `input` with structure from task
- execute `python main.py`

# Algorithm

complexity O(n)

# Logic

- read input file by lines
- For each line check tmp folder, where update files(where filenames are department names and value of these files are amounts) values, or create if the specific department file doesn't exist yet
- after generating loop across all tmp files and write right data sctrucutre in output file
